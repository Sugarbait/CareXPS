## PHI Breach Response

### Breach Assessment Process

#### Step 1: Preliminary Assessment (Within 1 hour)
**Assessment Questions:**
1. Was PHI accessed, acquired, used, or disclosed?
2. Was the access/disclosure authorized under HIPAA?
3. Does the incident compromise PHI security or privacy?
4. What is the nature and extent of PHI involved?
5. How many individuals are potentially affected?

#### Step 2: Risk Assessment (Within 24 hours)
**Risk Factors to Consider:**
- **Nature and extent of PHI involved**
  - Types of PHI (medical records, payment info, etc.)
  - Amount of PHI involved
  - Sensitivity of the information

- **Person who improperly used/disclosed PHI**
  - Employee vs. external party
  - Level of access and authorization
  - Intent (malicious vs. inadvertent)

- **Whether PHI was actually acquired or viewed**
  - Evidence of actual access or viewing
  - Technical logs and audit trails
  - Witness statements or admissions

- **Extent to which risk has been mitigated**
  - Immediate containment actions taken
  - Recovery of PHI if possible
  - Additional safeguards implemented

#### Step 3: Breach Determination (Within 48 hours)
**Low Probability of Compromise (Not a Breach):**
- Minimal risk to individuals
- Limited PHI exposure
