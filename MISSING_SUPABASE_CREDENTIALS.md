# MISSING SUPABASE CREDENTIALS

## The Problem
Your `.env.local` file is missing Supabase credentials, which is why sync isn't working.

## Current .env.local Content
```
# Local Environment Variables
# This file should not be committed to git

# OpenAI API Key for ChatGPT Help Chatbot
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
```

## What You Need to Add

Add these lines to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Required for cross-device sync)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

## How to Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Settings** → **API**
4. **Copy the values**:
   - **Project URL** → use as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **Project API Keys** → **anon/public** → use as `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **Project API Keys** → **service_role** → use as `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Complete .env.local Example

```bash
# Local Environment Variables
# This file should not be committed to git

# OpenAI API Key for ChatGPT Help Chatbot
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here

# Supabase Configuration (Required for cross-device sync)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# Security (Optional but recommended)
VITE_HIPAA_MODE=true
VITE_PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-phi-encryption-key
VITE_AUDIT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-audit-encryption-key
```

## After Adding the Credentials

1. **Save the `.env.local` file**
2. **Restart the dev server**: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again
3. **Test the connection**: Run `node test-db-connection.js`
4. **Test sync**: Try logging in and saving settings

## Why This Wasn't Working

Without Supabase credentials:
- ❌ App can't connect to Supabase
- ❌ Settings/MFA only save to localStorage (device-specific)
- ❌ No cross-device sync possible

With Supabase credentials:
- ✅ App connects to Supabase
- ✅ Settings/MFA save to cloud database
- ✅ Cross-device sync works
