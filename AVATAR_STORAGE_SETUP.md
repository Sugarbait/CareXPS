# Avatar Storage System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and test the new robust avatar storage system that ensures cross-device persistence and reliability.

## üéØ What's Been Enhanced

The new avatar storage system provides:

‚úÖ **Cross-device synchronization** - Avatars sync across all user devices
‚úÖ **Bulletproof persistence** - Multiple storage layers with fallbacks
‚úÖ **Automatic optimization** - Images are resized and compressed
‚úÖ **Robust error handling** - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
‚úÖ **HIPAA compliance** - Full audit trail and secure storage
‚úÖ **Storage cleanup** - Automatic removal of orphaned files

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration

Run the migration script to add avatar support to your database:

```sql
-- Execute the migration script
\i supabase-avatar-migration.sql
```

Or manually apply the migration in Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-avatar-migration.sql`
3. Execute the script

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Storage** ‚Üí **Buckets**
2. Click **New bucket**
3. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name**: `avatars`
   - **Public**: ‚úÖ Enabled (for public URLs)
   - **File size limit**: `5242880` (5MB)
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif`

### 3. Configure Storage Policies

In **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies**, add these Row Level Security policies for the `avatars` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow anyone to view avatars (public read)
CREATE POLICY "Public avatar access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own avatar" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file has the required Supabase configuration:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key (optional)
```

### 5. Initialize Avatar Service

The avatar service is automatically initialized when imported. To manually initialize:

```typescript
import { avatarStorageService } from '@/services/avatarStorageService'

// Initialize the service (optional - called automatically)
await avatarStorageService.initialize()
```

## üß™ Testing Cross-Device Persistence

### Test 1: Basic Avatar Upload

1. Log in to the application
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Profile**
3. Upload an avatar image (JPG, PNG, WebP, or GIF)
4. Verify the avatar appears in the UI
5. Check browser developer tools network tab for successful upload

### Test 2: Cross-Device Synchronization

1. **Device A**: Upload an avatar
2. **Device B**: Log in with the same user account
3. **Verify**: Avatar should automatically appear on Device B
4. **Device B**: Change the avatar
5. **Device A**: Refresh or re-login - should see the new avatar

### Test 3: Offline Fallback

1. Upload an avatar while online
2. Disconnect from internet
3. The avatar should still be visible (from localStorage cache)
4. Reconnect - avatar should sync from database

### Test 4: Error Recovery

1. Temporarily disable Supabase Storage (remove bucket permissions)
2. Try to upload an avatar - should show proper error message
3. Re-enable storage permissions
4. Upload should work again

### Test 5: Storage Cleanup

1. Upload multiple avatars for a user (each upload replaces the previous)
2. Only the latest avatar file should exist in storage
3. Check Supabase Storage dashboard to verify old files are cleaned up

## üîç Debugging

### Check Avatar Storage Status

```typescript
import { avatarStorageService } from '@/services/avatarStorageService'

// Get current avatar URL
const avatarUrl = await avatarStorageService.getAvatarUrl(userId)
console.log('Current avatar:', avatarUrl)

// Sync avatar across devices
const syncResult = await avatarStorageService.syncAvatarAcrossDevices(userId)
console.log('Sync result:', syncResult)
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Avatars bucket not found"
- **Solution**: Create the `avatars` bucket in Supabase dashboard

**Issue**: "Permission denied" errors
- **Solution**: Configure the storage policies as shown above

**Issue**: "Invalid avatar URL"
- **Solution**: Check that the URL validation function allows your storage URLs

**Issue**: Avatar not syncing across devices
- **Solution**: Check that the `users.avatar_url` column exists and is being updated

### Monitoring & Logs

The system logs all avatar operations to the audit log:

```sql
-- View recent avatar operations
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE action LIKE '%AVATAR%'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## üì± Mobile & Responsive Considerations

The avatar upload component automatically:
- Resizes images to 512x512 maximum
- Compresses images to reduce file size
- Supports touch/mobile file selection
- Shows upload progress

## üîí Security Features

- **File Type Validation**: Only allows image files
- **Size Limits**: Maximum 5MB per file
- **URL Validation**: Only accepts URLs from your Supabase storage
- **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged
- **RLS Policies**: Users can only modify their own avatars
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Orphaned files are automatically removed

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- **Image Compression**: Automatic JPEG compression at 80% quality
- **Size Optimization**: Images resized to optimal dimensions
- **Caching**: Multi-layer caching (localStorage + memory)
- **Lazy Loading**: Avatar URLs fetched only when needed
- **Background Sync**: Non-blocking synchronization

## üìä Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Upload Success Rate**: Track successful vs failed uploads
2. **Sync Reliability**: Monitor cross-device sync success
3. **Storage Usage**: Track total storage consumption
4. **Load Performance**: Avatar loading times
5. **Error Rates**: Failed operations and causes

## üîÑ Migration from Old System

If you have existing avatars in localStorage only:

```typescript
// Run this migration script to move localStorage avatars to the new system
async function migrateExistingAvatars() {
  const users = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('systemUsers') || '[]')

  for (const user of users) {
    if (user.avatar && user.avatar.startsWith('data:')) {
      console.log(`Migrating avatar for user: ${user.id}`)

      try {
        const result = await avatarStorageService.uploadAvatar(user.id, user.avatar)
        if (result.status === 'success') {
          console.log(`‚úÖ Migrated avatar for ${user.name}`)
        } else {
          console.error(`‚ùå Failed to migrate avatar for ${user.name}:`, result.error)
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`‚ùå Error migrating avatar for ${user.name}:`, error)
      }
    }
  }
}

// Run the migration
await migrateExistingAvatars()
```
