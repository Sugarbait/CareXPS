# Azure Function Email Service Configuration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to properly configure the Azure Function email notification service to work with Hostinger SMTP.

## Problem: 503 Service Unavailable
If you're seeing 503 errors, it means the Azure Function cannot access the `HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable.

## Solution: Configure Azure Application Settings

### Step 1: Access Azure Portal
1. Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Sign in with your Azure credentials
3. Find your Static Web App resource: **carexps** (or similar)

### Step 2: Configure Application Settings
1. In your Static Web App, click on **Configuration** in the left menu
2. Click on **Application Settings** tab
3. Click **+ Add** to add a new setting
4. Enter the following:
   - **Name:** `HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD`
   - **Value:** Your actual Hostinger email password for `carexps@phaetonai.com`
5. Click **OK**
6. Click **Save** at the top of the page
7. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

### Step 3: Restart Application (if needed)
1. Go to **Overview** in the left menu
2. Click **Restart** at the top
3. Wait for the application to restart

### Step 4: Verify Configuration
1. Check the Azure Function logs:
   - Go to **Functions** in the left menu
   - Click on `send-notification-email`
   - Click on **Monitor** or **Logs**
2. Look for diagnostic output showing:
   ```
   üîç === ENVIRONMENT DIAGNOSTICS ===
   HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD exists: true
   HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD length: <number>
   ‚úÖ Valid credentials detected
   ```

## Why GitHub Secrets Alone Don't Work

GitHub Actions secrets (`${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD }}`) are only available **during the build process**, not at runtime.

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions uses secrets during deployment
2. ‚ùå Deployed Azure Function **cannot access** GitHub secrets at runtime
3. ‚úÖ Azure Function **can access** Azure Application Settings

**Correct Configuration:**
- **GitHub Secrets:** Used for deploying (optional, can be removed from workflow)
- **Azure Application Settings:** Used at runtime (REQUIRED)

## Environment Variable Access Pattern

The Azure Function checks multiple environment variable names in order:
1. `HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD` (primary)
2. `hostinger_email_password` (lowercase fallback)
3. `EMAIL_PASSWORD` (generic fallback)
4. `SMTP_PASSWORD` (SMTP-specific fallback)

## Troubleshooting

### Check 1: Verify Environment Variable Exists
Look in Azure Function logs for:
```
HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD exists: true
HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD length: >0
```

If you see `exists: false`, the variable is not set in Azure Application Settings.

### Check 2: Verify Credentials Are Valid
Look for:
```
‚úÖ Valid credentials detected
```

If you see `‚ùå Invalid credentials detected`, the password may be:
- Empty or null
- Set to placeholder value `'your-email-password'`
- Incorrect password

### Check 3: Test SMTP Connection
The function includes detailed SMTP debugging. Look for:
```
SMTP DEBUG: Connection established
SMTP INFO: Authentication successful
```

If you see connection errors:
- Check network/firewall settings
- Verify Hostinger SMTP is accessible from Azure (smtp.hostinger.com:465)
- Ensure SSL/TLS is properly configured

### Check 4: Review Detailed Error Responses
The function now returns comprehensive error details:
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to send email",
  "message": "Authentication failed",
  "code": "EAUTH",
  "troubleshooting": [
    "Authentication failed - check HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD",
    "Verify credentials in Azure Application Settings"
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-09-30T..."
}
```

## Testing the Function

### Option 1: Test via Application
Use the CareXPS application to trigger an email notification.

### Option 2: Test via Azure Portal
1. Go to your Static Web App in Azure Portal
2. Navigate to **Functions** > `send-notification-email`
3. Click on **Code + Test**
4. Use the **Test/Run** feature with this payload:
```json
{
  "recipients": ["your-email@example.com"],
  "notification": {
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "message": "This is a test email from Azure Function",
    "type": "test",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Test via curl
```bash
curl -X POST https://carexps.nexasync.ca/api/send-notification-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipients": ["your-email@example.com"],
    "notification": {
      "title": "Test Notification",
      "message": "This is a test email",
      "type": "test",
      "timestamp": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }'
```

## Local Development

### Setup local.settings.json
For local testing, create `api/local.settings.json` (from template):
```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD": "your-actual-password"
  }
}
```

**Important:** `local.settings.json` is in `.gitignore` and should never be committed.

### Run locally
```bash
cd api
npm install
func start
```

The function will be available at `http://localhost:7071/api/send-notification-email`

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials:**
   - Don't hardcode passwords in source code
   - Don't commit `local.settings.json`
   - Use Azure Application Settings for production

2. **Rotate passwords regularly:**
   - Update Hostinger email password periodically
   - Update Azure Application Settings after rotation

3. **Use strong passwords:**
   - Ensure HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASSWORD is a strong password
   - Follow your organization's password policy

4. **Monitor logs:**
   - Regularly review Azure Function logs
   - Watch for authentication failures
   - Set up alerts for repeated failures

## Enhanced Features

### Comprehensive Diagnostics
Every request logs:
- Node.js version and platform
- Environment variable status (without exposing values)
- Azure-specific environment variables
- SMTP connection details

### CORS Support
The function properly handles CORS preflight requests for cross-origin calls.

### Timeout Handling
Email sending has a 30-second timeout to prevent hanging requests.

### Multiple Recipient Support
Uses BCC for privacy when sending to multiple recipients.

### Detailed Error Messages
Provides specific troubleshooting guidance based on error type:
- `EAUTH`: Authentication errors
- `ETIMEDOUT/ECONNECTION`: Network/connectivity issues
- `EENVELOPE`: Email validation errors
