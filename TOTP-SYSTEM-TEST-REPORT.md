## ⚠️ Known Issues & Considerations

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking):
1. **Legacy Service References:** Some files still reference old `totpService` but critical components use `cleanTotpService`
2. **Error Handling Edge Cases:** Some recovery mechanisms are more permissive than strict validation
3. **Multiple TOTP Services:** Several TOTP service implementations exist but `cleanTotpService` is the active one

### Recommendations:
1. **Gradual Migration:** Progressively update remaining components to use `cleanTotpService`
2. **Service Consolidation:** Consider deprecating unused TOTP service implementations
3. **Documentation:** Update component documentation to reflect `cleanTotpService` usage
